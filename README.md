This project aims to demonstrate how to properly use Docker for any kind of project.

It contains 3 services:

- [Blog](./blog) (Rust)
- [Catalog](./tv-shows-catalog) (Node.js)
- [Restaurant](./restaurant-website) (Php)

For each service, there is a development and production environment, and a CI pipeline to make sure everything is building correctly.

## Good practices üöÄ

Docker is a powerful tool, but it can be hard to use properly. 

Here are some good practices we followed:

- Use multi-stage builds to reduce the size of the final image.
- Use `.dockerignore` to avoid copying unnecessary files.
- Don't use `latest` tag for images, use a specific version instead.
- Don't use `root` user in your container, use a non-root user instead.
- Use environment variables to configure your application.
- Optimize layers cache by ordering your commands.
- Use `HEALTHCHECK` to check if your application is running correctly.

Learn more about good practices in the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/).
